As if pretty Pokhara needed a more beautiful cousin! Sarangkot is the cherry on top of a delicious cake. Privy to some spectacular views of the mountains; from Dhaulagiri to Machhapuchhare, this place can pass off god’s own spot. At any given hour, Sarangkot is at least a couple of degrees cooler than Pokhara. A great place to witness jaw dropping sunrises, but don’t expect to be the only one gasping in surprise. This place is very popular amongst tourists who want to catch a glimpse of the mighty Himalayas. Other than the magnificent vistas, there’s not much to do here except a couple of abandoned forts. A few hours is all you need to do justice to this place.

  <ol type="none">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 10%;"> Paragliding and ziplining is famous in this area. A number of adventure sport tour companies operate these activities from here.
To hike up to Sarangkot, take the trail from Sedi (just north along the lake from Pokhara). A nice one hour hike that is good for most hikers. The trail is marked well and there are steps in many places where it gets steep. Hold on to the ticket as it will give you access to the main view point at the top of the mountain.
