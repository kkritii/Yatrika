Named after an overzealous Swiss couple who as legend has it, subsequently drowned in its waters, Patale Chhango as the locals call it is a gorgeous waterfall that finds its way through tunnels and crevices. It forms an underground tunnel after reaching the bottom from its height of 500 meters. It runs 100 feet below ground level. Specially thunderous in the monsoons, be prepared for a deafening sound and a roaring cascade if youâ€™re going to visit this in all its glory.
