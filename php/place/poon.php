Breathtaking views and spectacular scenery awaits you when you reach atop Poon Hill. In most countries, Poon Hill would be called a mountain, but here in the Himalayas it is certainly a hill. Poon Hill is one of the most famous viewpoints in the world and in Nepal, it is probably the second most famous viewpoints after Kala Pattar.

There are many options to extend a trip here, and the only limits to the length of the trek are time and imagination. There are lodges all along the route so there’s little need to carry a huge pack. The trek is very popular and can be very crowded, so in other words, expect a great trip with lots of mountain views, but don’t expect solitude. The trail passes through several interesting villages and different cultures, and the scenery is also very spectacular.
