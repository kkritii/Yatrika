It forms an underground tunnel after reaching the bottom from its height of 500 meters. It runs 100 feet below ground level.

It is located in about 10 minutes drive from the heart of Pokhara city in the place named Batulechaur. The name Mahendra Cave is given after the name of Late King of Nepal Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. The cave is rich in variety of rocks especially limestone and the rocks sparkle when light strikes on it. The stone that is dripping from the roof and covering the cave floor comes alive under the beams of the flashlights and increases the excitement of this dark adventure.</span>
